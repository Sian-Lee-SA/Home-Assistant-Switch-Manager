name: Lutron Aurora Dimmer
service: Zigbee2MQTT
event_type: mqtt
mqtt_topic_format: zigbee2mqtt/+
info: Make sure to set your MQTT topic to not include "/action" at the end. These dimmer switches only send one kind of command, so they are best set up only to control light(s) with a "Press" sending a toggle service and a "Rotate" sending an on service using "{{ data.action_level }}" to set brightness level between 0 and 255. They can  also be used as a simple single-press button with another function assigned to any rotation (non-directional).
conditions:
  - key: action
    value: 'brightness_move_to_level'
buttons:
  - actions:
      - title: press
        conditions:
